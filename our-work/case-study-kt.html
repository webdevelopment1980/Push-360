                                    <p class="client-content" style="text-align: left;">
                                        Kitchen Treasures was born from the house of Synthite, the world’s largest
                                        producer of value added spices, with a history of over 4 decades in the
                                        production of spices, flavours, pure & blended seasonings and spice oleoresins.
                                        The outcome of this 40-year internship was the brand Kitchen Treasures, the
                                        retail face of the parent company, selling spices, masalas, pastes & pickles.
                                        The Synthite group is probably the largest supplier of premium ingredients for
                                        many leading Indian and International brands.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content" style="text-align: left;">
                                        In a market where quality is a big concern, with huge deficits in trust, Kitchen
                                        Treasures was poised to provide pure, clean, natural and high quality products.
                                        Its parent company’s huge leveraging in the industry provide them the production
                                        and procurement wherewithal to launch their portfolio, walking the talk of
                                        purity and quality. </p>
                                    <p class="client-content-heading">THE CHALLENGE </p>
                                    <p class="client-content" style="text-align: left;">
                                        Kitchen Treasures as a retail brand is an infant among old-timers. How do they
                                        launch their spices product line, capturing the interests of a polarised
                                        audience? National and regional players pepper the retail shelves pitching
                                        offers that range from ‘purity’ to ‘conformity to regional taste palettes’. The
                                        launch market was Kerala,
                                        which has a rich culture in spices and a plethora of brands catering to the
                                        market requirements.
                                        So, how do Kitchen Treasures be heard and bought into?

                                    <p class="client-content" style="text-align: left;">
                                        A brand born out of such immaculate pedigree needs a launch demeanor that
                                        captures the body language of ‘To the manor born’. No holding back. No doubts.
                                        No fear. When Sachin Tendulkar walked in to the Test arena when he was just 16
                                        years, he carried with him, a swag reserved for the Gods. He didn’t blink, nor
                                        did he hold back. He revealed his pedigree to the world. Our challenge is to
                                        capture similar leadership pedigree in communication terms, for brand Kitchen
                                        Treasures.

                                    <p class="client-content-heading">THE CAMPAIGN </p>
                                    <p class="client-content" style="text-align: left;">
                                        In a cluttered spices market, where many brand voices are chirping a cacophony,
                                        it is important to have a voice that is unique, a lyric that is sharp and a
                                        presenter who wears a stature befitting the strength and relevance of the
                                        message. This is why we aligned Manju Warrier as the brand ambassador for
                                        Kitchen Treasures. Manju is a celluloid queen who is known for her realistic
                                        depiction of characters on screen. She has an arresting screen presence and a
                                        powerful countenance. We chose her, as the brand messaging required a voice and
                                        authenticity that supported its relevance and importance. This is our
                                        contribution to the brand in its journey to market leadership. Crafting a strong
                                        brand narrative as well as giving it a face and a powerful voice, to be heard
                                        above everyone else. And to be believed.

                                    <p class="client-content" style="text-align: left;">
                                        In its first year of launch, the spices segment of Kitchen Treasures ate into
                                        the market shares of competition like an epidemic! It continues to blaze its way
                                        through the competition line up, and is surely poised for market leadership by
                                        year 2018, going by the statistics. This is also one of the most recognised and
                                        recollected campaigns in the packaged foods segment in Kerala.
