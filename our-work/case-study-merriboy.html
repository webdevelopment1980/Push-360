                                    <p class="client-content">Merriboy Ice Creams have come out of 3 brothers’ passion
                                        for ice creams. The best of ingredients, passionate investments in R&D and a
                                        desire to bring to its customers a brand that has all the purity inherent in
                                        milk and real fruits, describes the genesis of Merriboy.
                                        Merriboy aims to be the only brand of ice creams in the country that boasts of
                                        fully natural ingredients. From natural flavour to natural colour to natural/
                                        real fruits and pure milk. The ‘pristine purity’ of the brand is a result of its
                                        owners’ in-depth knowledge of the product and the category.
                                        Merriboy was placed under our tutorship for readying it for market leadership in
                                        the South, in the year 2012. Real competition was from regional giants like
                                        Lazza Ice Creams, and also from National players like Amul, Kwality Walls,
                                        Mother Dairy, Arun Ice Creams etc. These constituted the mid-range price points,
                                        and are segmented away from the niche category defined by Baskin Robbins etc.

                                    <p class="client-content-heading">THE CHALLENGE </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">
                                        How do we build a brand of repute and build affinity with an audience who grew
                                        up on the taste and availability of Lazza, Amul, Kwality Walls etc.? What in our
                                        manufacturing process or product definition can become our key differentiator?
                                        The marketing might of the competition and their presence in the market for
                                        decades, presents an ominous task ahead to run a profitable enterprise
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content-heading">OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE BRIEF </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">Success and reputation of others are not qualities that we
                                        should be intimidated by. In fact, creating a new product story/narrative will
                                        always get the attention of the consumer. And if we are committed to producing a
                                        great product, and are honest in delivering to the promise, we can take on
                                        anyone in the market. <br>
                                        Merriboy’s commitment to producing ‘natural’ ice creams took our interest.
                                        That’s a great proposition for an indulgence product category. Indulgence
                                        categories operate under the guillotine of ‘Un-healthy’. But we do give into its
                                        temptation. But since youngsters and kids are its major consumers, there is
                                        always a guilt attached with having too much of the same or allowing kids to
                                        have more. This is where the ‘natural’ proposition comes into play for the
                                        brand.
                                        But our challenge will be to package ‘natural’ in layers of taste and flavour.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content-heading">THE CAMPAIGN </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">We built the entire campaign around the proposition of
                                        ‘natural’. Natural flavour, colour, taste and real ingredients. The campaign
                                        stressed upon the drool factor whereby creating the crave, which is critical for
                                        an indulgence category.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content-heading">But the real difference was in creating the
                                        interpretation of ‘natural’. </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">We strategically used Manju Warrier, the highly respected
                                        Malayalam actress, who is known for her natural histrionics. When Manju
                                        represented and propagated the brand’s ‘natural’ proposition, the impact was
                                        compelling. People started questioning their current brand of choice. Are they
                                        also natural?
                                        <br>
                                        This resulted in competition changing their marketing strategy to counter this
                                        threat and loss of their market shares. It paved the way for aggressive and
                                        often ‘distasteful’ positions taken by an unsettled and threatened competition.
                                        Our ‘natural’ positioning and strategic use of the apt brand ambassador, hit
                                        hard on competition.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="client-content">Year 1 of the campaign period:
