                                        emergent jewellery brand in the 90s.
                                        From a 300 crore company, Kalyan Jewellers is today a 12,000 crore megalith. And
                                        we are proud to proclaim that we partnered with Kalyan, through thick and thin,
                                        every step of the way.</p>
                                    <p class="client-content">Breaking the mould in jewellery advertising of that time,
                                        we zagged when the
                                        rest followed conventional wisdom. For the first time in jewellery
                                        advertising,</p>
                                    <p class="client-content">we made the man the protagonist, a result of research we
                                        commissioned to
                                        identify the real influencer in jewellery purchase.
                                        The second salvo was the use of regional celebrities for each state as
                                        against
                                        one big national celebrity.</p>
                                    <p class="client-content">In a category that hinged on trust and credibility, the
                                        strategy to use a
                                        celebrity who was one of their own turned the tide in Kalyan’s favour. This
                                        strategy generated enough traction for the brand in each market and the brand
                                        grew exponentially.</p>
                                    <p class="client-content">Then, there was the path-breaking concept of ‘My Kalyan’,
                                        a stand-alone retail
                                        store unit that provides an advisory service besides retailing of gold to shield
                                        the customer from irregularities and inconsistencies of the industry</p>

                                    <p class="client-content">
                                        This brand follows the trajectory of conventional marketing wisdom and is a
                                        testament of how structured market and consumer understanding as well as brand
                                        development techniques can create strong brand value. When the brand decided to
                                        enter other markets where it was unknown, we designed and analysed extensive
                                        consumer research, both qualitative and quantitative, to understand needs, wants
                                        and desires of consumers of jewellery. Product range assessments were carried
                                        out with real samples to understand cultural differences. Trade interviews added
                                        a seller’s perspective. This understanding powered the first foray into closer
                                        cultures across the Southern markets.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">
                                        We realised that gold jewellery, unlike diamond or other gem studded jewellery
                                        is a matter of investment rather than aesthetic apparel. And while the blushing
                                        bride’s opinion regarding design would be one factor to be taken into
                                        consideration, the investment value and hence the authenticity of the supplier
                                        was much more important to the true decision maker i.e. the parents actually
                                        investing the funds.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">
                                        Hence, the brand building began first with 2 core product benefits as
                                        differentiators which were unmet needs – the presence of the BIS mark which most
                                        players did not bother with and demonstrating how price promotions actually did
                                        not benefit the consumer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">
                                        For a small local player to make these claims credibly, we needed it to come
                                        from affluent people who would be expected to have the knowhow and legal
                                        resources to check if these claims were actually true. Hence we had a genuine
                                        role for a celebrity and a creative treatment that used them to advantage. The
                                        strong growth registered by the brand in the South markets were proof that the
                                        approach worked.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">
                                        Once the product benefits were established in the initial years of launch (and
                                        we heartily commend our client who has the good business sense to know when
                                        spending is required) we then laddered up these benefits to the emotional
                                        benefit area, taking on the platform of ‘Trust’ - a word that is synonymous with
                                        the brand today.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">And while this continued to reap dividends, when the time
                                        came to take the brand across the Vindhyas, to a completely different cultural
                                        milieu, an equally extensive understanding was carried out amongst these
                                        consumer markets to test if the brand approach needed to be modified in any of
                                        the marketing parameters. Largely, the tested launch path was found to be
                                        relevant, and the brand now chose to bring in a celebrity with national and
                                        global relevance. Mr. Bachchan came on board and the rest is history.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">
                                        Kalyan became the first Indian jewellery brand to get funding from Warburg
                                        Pincus. It also serves as a great example to brand owners who question the
                                        utility of investing in brand building activities such as research, advisory
                                        services and impactful advertising and get trapped in the short term comfort of
                                        driving sales.

                                    <p class="client-content">Kalyan Jewellers, the fastest growing jewellery brand of
                                        India, had over 70+ showrooms spread across India around the time they launched
                                        in Dubai. Push Integrated, the agency which was instrumental in growing Kalyan
                                        Jewellers from a 2 store retail brand from Kerala into a 110+ showroom today,
                                        was assigned the massive task of launching the brand in the Middle East,
                                        starting with Dubai and Abu Dhabi. </p>
                                    <p class="client-content-heading">THE HISTORY OF KALYAN STORE LAUNCHES </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">Brand Kalyan Jewellers carved a niche for itself in
                                        whichever new market it entered. Thousands came to witness the event and shop on
                                        the opening day. The highlight of these openings were also about the superstar
                                        brand endorsers of Kalyan. </p>
                                    <p class="client-content-heading">THE CHALLENGE </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">The client expected Push to create the same fervour and
                                        magic and attract the Indian diaspora from the Middle East to the store on the
                                        launch day. One must understand that Middle East was not an easy market when it
                                        came to gold as it was filled with retail jewellery players of all sizes. There
                                        were half a dozen brands that had already made its way into this region,
                                        successfully running their businesses. </p>
                                    <p class="client-content-heading">THE IDEA</p>
                                    <p class="client-content">After much thought, Push hit upon an idea that could not
                                        get any better or bigger. The idea was to create a dent in the market and to
                                        achieve that it had to do something different. And nothing could be more unique
                                        than launching 5 stores spread across the city of Dubai and 1 store in Abu Dhabi
                                        on the same day. These stores were to be opened by Kalyan Brand Ambassadors –
                                        Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai, Akineni Nagarjuna, Prabhu Ganesan and Manju
                                        Warrier. The client bought the idea and team Push got working on it. It was no
                                        longer a launch, but 6 launches on the same day. In the evening, all these stars
                                        will preside over a function for the crème d’la crème of Dubai, which had
                                        Shankar Mahadevan in concert at a prominent venue.
                                        <br>
                                        Communications across all mediums was created with the same thought where all
                                        brand ambassadors were landing into Dubai and Abu Dhabi in interesting ways.
                                        This campaign happened over print, outdoor, television and radio.

                                        <br>
                                        In short, Dubai was carpet bombed with the campaign. The campaign started
                                        building the desired buzz and soon, everyone in Dubai was only talking about the
                                        Kalyan Jewellers launch. Expectations and anticipation grew.

                                    <p class="client-content">With surgical precision, planning, starting from
                                        logistics, venue, security, invitation, permissions, stage, crowd control and
                                        more, all 6 stores were launched on the same day. On the day of the launch, all
                                        the brand endorsers went to the showrooms together. Dubai and Abu Dhabi had
                                        never seen such an event happen ever. Thousands of fans waiting hours before the
                                        stars arrived to witness the event were excited and were thrilled when the
                                        superstars interacted with them. The event was a massive success. It was
                                        imperative to make noise and make its presence felt right from the start. It did
                                        that well and the resonance of it is still being felt even to this day. Kalyan
                                        Jewellers immediately became the number 2 store in the region and continues to
                                        enjoy that position.

                                        that helped Kalyan Jewellers reach out to its customers across tier 2 & 3 cities

                                        This model neutralised the inertia of middle class and lower income groups
                                        across the mofussil areas of our country, to interact with the larger than life
                                        brand, Kalyan.

                                    <p class="client-content">The key challenge for Kalyan was to engineer an
                                        ‘inclusive’ growth, taking ‘Middle India’ with them.

                                        To attain this, ‘reach’ was critical. Kalyan Jewellers was more an urban brand
                                        till then. It catered to the middle income as well as a percentage of high
                                        spenders on jewellery. Our surging economy saw a robust change for the better in
                                        terms of spending power across tier 2 and tier 3 cities that formed the extended
                                        catchment area.

                                    <p class="client-content-heading">How do we reach out to these customers?
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="client-content">The solution was a business idea that marked the turning
                                        point in jewellery retail in the country. Push Integrated suggested and
                                        recommended Kalyan to start small ‘advisory’ outlets that keeps product
                                        brochures on which the customers could book their orders as well as bring to the
                                        mofussil customers, the path-breaking ‘Gold Saving Schemes’ of the brand. The
                                        nature of the shops neutralised the intimidating demeanor of a leading jewellery
                                        retail outlet. Its friendly approach made the My Kalyan outlets a big hit with
                                        customers. These outlets actually went on to become their local advisors on gold
                                        investments and marriage purchases.

                                    <p class="client-content">Kalyan launched 100 outlets in 1 day! That was the scale
                                        of the launch and their belief in this business model. Where the infrastructure
                                        investments were low, but could provide top-notch advisory services as well as
                                        book orders for that captive audience, who were never approached in the past by
                                        any other top jeweller.

                                        In the first year of launch of My Kalyan, the business extension contributed 25%
                                        to the company’s total revenue. This has become a case study in business
                                        transformation, and have become part of the curriculum of leading business
